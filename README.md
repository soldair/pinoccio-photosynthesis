pinoccio-photosynthesis
=======================

ndvi / photosynthesis detector on a pinoccio backpack!

based off of tech and teaching from http://publiclab.org/wiki/ndvi those folks are awesome.


this uses 2 photo sensors covered by specific color filters used in photgraphy to produce from diffused ambient light the rate of photosynthesis. the result is the NDVI which is a number based on ratio of red consumed by plants to the near IR range of light leftover.
